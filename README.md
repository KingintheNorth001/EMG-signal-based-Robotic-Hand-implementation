# EMG-signal-based-Robotic-Hand-implementation
Electromyography (EMG) is a powerful tool for detecting neuromuscular activity, enabling  the development of intelligent prosthetics, gesture-controlled systems, and rehabilitation  devices. This project focuses on the classification of upper limb movements using surface  EMG signals collected from multiple participants.
